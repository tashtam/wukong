User Story 1: Maze Challenges
As a player, I want to encounter unique and increasingly complex maze challenges in each level, 
so that I can experience a sense of accomplishment when solving intricate puzzles, and unlock 
new areas or levels as a reward for my progress. These challenges should vary in design, requiring 
different strategies and thinking patterns, thereby keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging.

User Story 2: Enemies
As a player, I want to encounter a diverse range of enemies within the maze, each possessing 
unique behaviors, attack styles, and difficulty levels, to ensure that every encounter feels 
distinct and unpredictable. This variety should keep me on my toes, requiring me to adapt my 
strategy and skills to defeat different enemies, which in turn will enhance the overall 
challenge and excitement of the game.

User Story 3: Movement
As a player, I want to have fluid and responsive control over my character’s movements, 
allowing me to move left, right, forward, and backward with precision. This control will 
enable me to thoroughly explore the maze, navigate through tight spaces, avoid traps, 
and interact seamlessly with various elements in the game world. The movement mechanics 
should feel intuitive and be integral to the exploration and puzzle-solving aspects of 
the game.

User Story 4: Inventory System
As a player, I want to be able to collect, manage, and utilize a variety of items within
an inventory system, so that I can strategically enhance my character’s abilities and 
interact with the game world more effectively. This system should allow me to easily 
access and organize items, understand their effects, and make decisions about when and 
how to use them, adding a layer of depth to the gameplay and enabling different playstyles.
